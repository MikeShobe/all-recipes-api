#Angular-API

##Summary
Angular-API will teach you the fundamentals of Angular

Our goal in this challenge is to build an angular app that will serve as a marketing page for the scraping API we built in the previous unit. 

# Getting Started
1.  `bower install` to install our angular dependencies
1.  Hop into the client folder and take a look at whats going on in there.
1. The dependency injection has already been set up for you, we have a homepage set up that uses [ui-router](https://github.com/angular-ui/ui-router/wiki) . (a great way to get the hang of it is to check out [their sample app](http://angular-ui.github.io/ui-router/sample/). Remember this is javascript so feel free to browse the source code.
1. Use the different templates and figure out how you would use angular to sell your api.
1. Run `npm start` and go to `localhost:3000`
